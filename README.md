# Fraud Detection API (Python Django Project)

The Fraud Detection API is a Python Django web application designed to detect fraudulent activities. It leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze transactions and messages for potential fraud.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Fraud Detection API, ensure you have Python, pip, and Django installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-api.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd fraud-detection-api`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the Django migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
5. Start the Django development server: `python manage.py runserver`

## Features

### Detecting Fraudulent Transactions

The API provides an endpoint to analyze transaction data and predict fraudulent transactions.

- **Endpoint**: `/fraud/`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Payload**: A JSON object containing transaction details such as `type`, `amount`, `oldbalanceOrg`, and `newbalanceOrig`.
- **Response**: A JSON object with a `prediction` key indicating the likelihood of fraud (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraudulent).

### Detecting Fraudulent Messages

The API also offers an endpoint to evaluate the content of messages for potential fraud.

- **Endpoint**: `/polls/`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Payload**: A JSON object containing the `text` of the message.
- **Response**: A JSON object with a `prediction` key indicating the likelihood of fraud (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraudulent).

## Usage

To use the Fraud Detection API, send a POST request to the appropriate endpoint with the required JSON payload. The API will return a prediction based on the input data.
